    "## GMM vs. MLE: Strengths and weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "A paper by {cite}`FuhrerEtAl:1995` studies the accuracy and efficiency of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator versus the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator in the context of a simple linear-quadratic inventory model. They find that ML has some very nice properties over GMM in small samples when the model is simple. In the spirit of the {cite}`FuhrerEtAl:1995` paper, we list the strengths and weaknesses of MLE vs. GMM more generally. I recommend you read the introduction to {cite}`FuhrerEtAl:1995`. This paper provides big support for maximum likelihood estimation over generalized method of moments. However, GMM estimation allows for less strong assumptions.\n",
    "* GMM almost always rejects the model (Hansen J-test)\n",
    "* MLE supports the model, kind of by assumption\n",
    "* \"Monte Carlo experiments reveal that the GMM estimates are often biased (apparently due to poor instruments), statistically insignificant, economically implausible, and dynamically unstable.\"\n",
    "* \"The ML estimates are generally unbiased (even in misspecifipd models), statistically significant, economically plausible, and dynamically stable.\"\n",

    "### MLE strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "* More statistical significance. In general, MLE provides more statistical significance for parameter estimates than does GMM. This comes from the strong distributional assumptions that are necessary for the ML estimates.\n",
    "* ML estimates are less sensitive to parameter or model normalizations than are GMM estimates.\n",
    "* ML estimates have nice small sample properties. ML estimates have less bias and more efficiency with small data samples than GMM estimates in many cases.\n",

    "\n",
    "(SecGMM_MLEwk)=\n",
    "### MLE weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "* MLE requires strong distributional assumptions. For MLE, the data generating process (DGP) must be completely specified. This assumes a lot of knowledge about the DGP. This assumption is likely almost always wrong.\n",
    "* MLE is very difficult in rational expectations models. This is because the consistency of beliefs induces a nonlinearity in the likelihood function that makes it difficult to find the global optimum.\n",
    "* MLE is very difficult in nonlinear models. The likelihood function can become highly nonlinear in MLE even if the model is linear when the data are irregular. This difficulty is multiplied when the model itself is more complicated and nonlinear.\n",

    "(SecGMM_GMMstr)=\n",
    "### GMM strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "* GMM allows for most flexible identification. GMM estimates can be identified by any set of moments from the data as long as you have at least as many moments as you have parameters to estimate and that those moments are independent enough to identify the parameters. (And the parameters are independent enough of each other to be separately identified.)\n",
    "* Good large sample properties. The GMM estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. GMM will likely be the best estimator if you have a lot of data.\n",
    "* GMM requires minimal assumptions about the DGP. In GMM, you need not specify the distributions of the error terms in your model of the DGP. This is often a strength, given that most error are not observed and most models are gross approximations of the true DGP.\n",

    "\n",
    "(SecGMM_GMMwk)=\n",
    "### GMM weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "* GMM estimates are usually less statistically significant than ML estimates. This comes from the minimal distributional assumptions. GMM parameter estimates usually are measured with more error.\n",
    "* GMM estimates can be sensitive to normalizations of the model or parameters.\n",

    "### Key questions when deciding between MLE and GMM\n",
    "\n",
    "* How much data is available for the estimation? Large data samples will make GMM relatively more attractive than MLE because of the nice large sample properties of GMM and fewer required assumptions on the model.\n",
    "* How complex is the model? Linear models or quadratic models are much easier to do using MLE than are more highly nonlinear models. Rational expectations models (macroeconomics) create an even more difficult level of nonlinearity that pushes you toward GMM estimation.\n",
    "* How comfortable are you making strong distributional assumptions? MLE requires a complete specification of all distributional assumptions of the model DGP. If you think these assumptions are too strong, you should use GMM.\n",

    "## The GMM estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "GMM was first formalized by {cite}`Hansen:1982`. A strength of GMM estimation is that the econometrician can remain completely agnostic as to the distribution of the random variables in the DGP. For identification, the econometrician simply needs at least as many moment conditions from the data as he has parameters to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *moment* of the data is broadly defined as any statistic that summarizes the data to some degree. A data moment could be as narrow as an individual observation from the data or as broad as the sample average. GMM estimates the parameters of a model or data generating process to make the model moments as close as possible to the corresponding data moments. See {cite}`DavidsonMacKinnon:2004`, chapter 9 for a more detailed treatment of GMM. The estimation methods of linear least squares, nonlinear least squares, generalized least squares, and instrumental variables estimation are all specific cases of the more general GMM estimation method.\n",

There is also a stochastic way to generate moments from the model, which we discuss later in our section on Simulated Method of Moments (SMM).\n",

But it is important to recognize that your estimates $\\hat{\\theta}_{GMM}$ will be dependent on what distance measure (norm) you choose. The most widely studied and used distance metric in GMM estimation is the $L^2$ norm or the sum of squared errors in moments. Define the moment error function $e(x|\\theta)$ as the $R \\times 1$ vector of either the percent difference in the vector of model moments from the data moments or the simple difference.\n",

    "It is important when possible that the error function $e(x|\\theta)$ be a percent deviation of the moments (given that none of the data moments are 0). This puts all the moments in the same units, which helps make sure that no moments receive unintended weighting simply due to their units. This ensures that the problem is scaled properly and does not suffer from ill conditioning. However, percent deviations become computationally problematic when the data moments are zero or close to zero. In that case, you would use a simple difference.\n",

The $R\\times R$ weighting matrix $W$ in the criterion function allows the econometrician to control how each moment is weighted in the minimization problem.

The black line is the ML estimate of $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ of the truncated normal pdf. The red and the green lines are just the PDF's of two \"arbitrarily\" chosen combinations of the truncated normal parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$.\n",

    "An issue that we saw in the examples from Section {ref}`SecGMM_Ex` is that there is some science as well as some art in choosing moments to identify the parameters in a GMM estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ parameters were identified more precisely when using the two-step estimator of the optimal weighting matrix instead of the identity matrix.\n",
    "* The overidentified four-moment model of total scores produced much smaller standard errors for both $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ than did the two-moment model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the parameter vector $\\theta$ has $K$ elements, or rather, $K$ parameters to be estimated. In order to estimate $\\theta$ by GMM, you must have at least as many moments as parameters to estimate $R\\geq K$. If you have exactly as many moments as parameters to be estimated $R=K$, the model is said to be *exactly identified*. If you have more moments than parameters to be estimated $R>K$, the model is said to be *overidentified*. If you have fewer moments than parameters to be estimated $R<K$, the model is said to be *underidentified*. There are good reasons to overidentify $R>K$ the model in GMM estimation as we saw in the previous example. The main reason is that not all moments are orthogonal. That is, some moments convey roughly the same information about the data and, therefore, do not separately identify any extra parameters. So a good GMM model often is overidentified $R>K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last point about GMM regards moment selection and verification of results. The real world has an infinite supply of potential moments that describe some part of the data. Choosing moments to estimate parameters by GMM requires understanding of the model, intuition about its connections to the real world, and artistry. A good GMM estimation will include moments that have some relation to or story about their connection to particular parameters of the model to be estimated. In addition, a good verification of a GMM estimation is to take some moment from the data that was not used in the estimation and see how well the corresponding moment from the estimated model matches that *outside moment*.\n",

    "The most common method of estimating the parameters of a linear regression is using the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. This estimator is just special type of generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. A simple regression specification in which the dependent variable $y_i$ is a linear function of two independent variables $x_{1,i}$ and $x_{2,i}$ is the following:\n",

You can think of the $N$ observations of $y_i$ as $N$ data moments. And you can think of the $N$ observations of $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i}$ as $N$ model moments. The least squares estimator minimizes the sum of squared errors, which is the sum of squared deviations between the $N$ values of $y_i$ and  $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i}$.\n",

    "But you could also just estimate the coefficients using the criterion function in the GMM statement of the problem above. This method is called nonlinear least squares or generalized least squares. Many applications of regression use a weighting matrix in the criterion function that adjusts for issues like heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, many applications use a different distance metric than the weighted sum of squared errors for the difference in moments. Sum of squared errors puts a large penalty on big differences. Sometimes you might want to maximize the sum of absolute errors, which is sometimes called median regression. You could also minimize the maximum absolute difference in the errors, which is even more extreme than the sum of squared errors on penalizing large differences.\n",
