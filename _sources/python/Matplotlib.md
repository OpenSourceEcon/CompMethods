# Matplotlib

Many plotting packages for Python.  Some of the most popular are [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/), [Bokeh](http://bokeh.org/), and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).  Of these, Matplotlib is the most general for static images and is what is used on `OG-Core`. Once you have a general idea of how to create plots in Python, that knowlege will generalize (to varying degrees) to the other plotting packages.
