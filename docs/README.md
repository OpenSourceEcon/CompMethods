# Instructions for files in CompMethods/docs
The files in this directory `CompMethods/docs/` include images and all the files necessary for rendering the Jupyter Book documentation. One image [`CompMethodsLogo_gitfig.png`](docs/CompMethodsLogo_gitfig.png) is only used for the GitHub social preview image. GitHub suggests that this image should be 1280x640px for best display. The image we created [`CompMethodsLogo_horizontal.png`](docs/CompMethodsLogo_horizontal.png) is natively 759x267px. We do the following to resize the image.

1. Open the image in Adobe Photoshop: **File** > **Open**
2. Open the **Image Size** dialogue:
3. Adjust the canvas size: **Image** > **Canvas Size**. Because the 759x276px image is relatively wider than the optimal 1280x640px GitHub size, we first adjust the canvas size. We have to add a little width and some moderate height. So here adjust the canvas width to 760px and then increase the height to half that size 380px.
4. Adjust the image size: **Image** > **Image Size**. Now adjust the image size to the GitHub optimal 1280x640px. The dimesions will be correct and nothing will be stretched.
5. Save the image as [`CompMethodsLogo_gitfig.png`](docs/CompMethodsLogo_gitfig.png).
6. Upload the image [`CompMethodsLogo_gitfig.png`](docs/CompMethodsLogo_gitfig.png) as the GitHub social preview image by clicking on the [**Settings**](https://github.com/OpenSourceEcon/CompMethods/settings) button in the upper-right of the main page of the repository and uploading the formatted image [`CompMethodsLogo_gitfig.png`](docs/CompMethodsLogo_gitfig.png) in the **Social preview** section.
