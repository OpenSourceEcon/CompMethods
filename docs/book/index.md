# Computational Methods for Economists using Python

This site contains open access tutorial materials and exercises for learning and using modern computational methods used by economists and data scientists. These materials have been developed by [Richard W. Evans](https://sites.google.com/site/rickecon) since 2008 primarily through the following endeavors:
* (2008-2016) Assistant Professor, Department of Economics, Brigham Young University. Taught undergraduate courses in macroeconomics, international finance, advanced macroeconomics, computational methods.
* (2012-2016) Co-founder and co-director of the BYU Macroeconomics and Computational Laboratory.
* (2013-2016) Co-PI, National Science Foundation Grant for original development of Applied and Computational Math Emphasis (ACME) curriculum at Brigham Young University.
* (2013-present) National advisory board member for the Applied and Computational Math Emphasis (ACME), Brigham Young University.

The core maintainer of this project is the following:
* [**Richard W. Evans**](https://sites.google.com/site/rickecon), Senior Research Fellow and Director of Open Policy, Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University; President and Co-founder, Open Research Group, Inc. (GitHub handle: [@rickecon](https://github.com/rickecon))
