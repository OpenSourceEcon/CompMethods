1. Define household FOC for savings and use `scipy.optimize.root` to solve for the optimal savings rate for a household with CRRA utility
2. Define the household FOC for labor supply and use `scipy.optimize.root` to solve for the optimal labor supply for a household with ellipitcal utility
3. Use `scipy.optimize.minimize` to minimize the function $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$ (or some other function).
4. Use `scipy.optimize.minimize` to minimize the function $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$ (or some other function) subject to the constraint that $x \geq 2$.
5. Use `scipy.interpolate`...
