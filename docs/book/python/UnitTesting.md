# Unit Testing

Testing of your source code is important to ensure that the results of your code are accurate and to cut down on debugging time.  Fortunately, `Python` has a nice suite of tools for unit testing.  In this section, we will introduce the `pytest` package and show how to use it to test your code.

# Exercises

1. Take simple function to minimize from SciPy and write a unit test for it (know analytic solutions so can test that SciPy is working correctly)
2. Another single test where assert that object a certain type
3. Use the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to test a function for multiple inputs
4. Use pytest markers to skip a test
